## Easier Than Ever

Thanks to this effort, all Designs published to the [Meshery Catalog](https://meshery.io/catalog) will automatically be available through the [ArtifactHub Package Search](https://artifacthub.io/packages/search?repo=meshery-catalog&sort=relevance&page=1). This means users can access a curated library of Designs to create, manage, and deploy cloud-native architectures with ease. 

Meshery, as a [Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF)](https://www.cncf.io/) project, is proud to enhance its integration with another CNCF project, [ArtifactHub](https://artifacthub.io). 

Meshery Designs provide a powerful way to represent and visualize cloud-native infrastructure and the Meshery Catalog functions much like a cloud marketplace, providing a user-friendly interface for accessing Designs. Now that these Designs are available on ArtifactHub it makes it easier than ever for users to deploy and visualize cloud-native infrastructure.


## Explore the New Designs

You can explore the new Meshery Designs by visiting the [ArtifactHub search page](https://artifacthub.io/packages/search?kind=24&sort=relevance&page=1). Dive in and discover a wide variety of designs to help you with your cloud-native projects. We invite you to join us in celebrating this fantastic milestone. Whether you're a seasoned Kubernetes expert or new to the cloud-native world, there’s something for everyone in the library of Meshery Designs now available on ArtifactHub.

## What's Next?

Our journey doesn't end here. We are committed to continually improving the integration between Meshery and ArtifactHub. Stay tuned for more updates, including the proposed integration of Meshery Snapshots, which will provide visual diagrams of Helm Charts hosted on ArtifactHub.

Thank you to the incredible Meshery and ArtifactHub communities for making this milestone possible. Let’s continue to build and innovate together!

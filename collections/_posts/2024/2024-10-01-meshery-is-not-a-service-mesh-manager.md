As a self-service engineering platform, Meshery enables collaborative design and operation of cloud and cloud native infrastructure. Meshery is not service mesh-centric. Meshery is not service mesh-focused. Meshery is for modern and collaborative DevOps engineering teams, infrastructure teams, Site Reliability Engineer, Platform Engineers, Application Development and Service delivery teams to use an internal engineering platform for the Day 0 design, Day 1 deployment, and Day 2 operation of cloud and cloud native infrastructure and services.

**The Evolution of Meshery**

Meshery has been referred to as a service mesh manager, however, that is only a small component of what Meshery offers. In it's post v0.5 releases, Meshery has grown into more of its original vision as a much broader and more powerful platform. It's now more accurately described as a **cloud native manager**.

**A Platform for Engineering Teams**

Here's why the "service mesh manager" label no longer even comes close to fully encompasses Meshery's capabilities:

* **Multi-cluster Management:** Meshery can manage multiple Kubernetes clusters, enabling unified control and visibility across your entire infrastructure.
* **Cloud Native Performance Management:** Meshery provides tools for baselining, tracking, and optimizing the performance of your microservices and non-microservices and the underlying infrastructure, including Kubernetes and multi-cloud environments.
* **Configuration Best Practices:** Meshery helps you assess your configurations against established best practices for Kubernetes and the entire ecosystem of multi-cloud services and cloud native technologies, encompassing all CNCF projects, ensuring optimal deployment and operation.
* **WebAssembly Filter Management:** Meshery allows you to dynamically load and manage WebAssembly filters for Envoy proxies, enabling advanced traffic management and control.
* **Cloud Native Design Patterns:** Meshery provides access to a catalog of cloud native patterns and a design configurator, simplifying the design and management of your cloud native infrastructure.
* **Unified Policy Engine:** Meshery incorporates a context-aware policy engine based on Open Policy Agent (OPA), allowing you to enforce configuration best practices and custom rules across your environment.

**A Holistic Approach to Cloud Native Management**

Meshery's expanded capabilities make it a comprehensive tool for managing all aspects of your cloud native environment. It empowers you to:

* **Streamline Operations:** Manage the lifecycle, configuration, and performance of cloud and cloud native infrastructure from a single platform.
* **Enhance Collaboration:** Facilitate collaboration among development, operations, and security teams through shared visibility and control.
* **Optimize Performance:** Gain insights into the performance of your applications and infrastructure, identify bottlenecks, and optimize resource utilization.
* **Enforce Best Practices:** Ensure consistent adherence to configuration best practices and security policies across your environment.

**Conclusion**

Meshery's vision from the start of the project has always been an extensible management platform. It's now a versatile, powerful, extensible, collaborative, cloud native manager that provides a holistic approach to the processes by which teams manage their infrastructure management. Through understanding this broader perspective, you can unlock the full potential of Meshery and accelerate your cloud native journey.

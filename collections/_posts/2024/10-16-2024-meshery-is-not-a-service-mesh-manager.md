As a self-service engineering platform, Meshery enables collaborative design and operation of cloud and cloud native infrastructure.

Meshery is not service mesh centric. Meshery is for modern and collaborative DevOps engineering teams, infrastructure teams, Site Reliability Engineer, Platform Engineers, Application Development and Service delivery teams to use an internal engineering platform for the Day 0 design, Day 1 deployment, and Day 2 opeeration of cloud and cloud native infrastructure and services.

**The Evolution of Meshery**

Meshery has often been referred to as a service mesh manager. While this was partially true in its early days, Meshery has evolved into something much broader and more powerful. It's now more accurately described as a **cloud native manager**. 

**Beyond Service Meshes**

Here's why the "service mesh manager" label no longer fully encompasses Meshery's capabilities:

* **Multi-cluster Management:** Meshery can manage multiple Kubernetes clusters, enabling unified control and visibility across your entire infrastructure.
* **Cloud Native Performance Management:** Meshery provides tools for baselining, tracking, and optimizing the performance of your microservices and the underlying infrastructure, including Kubernetes and service meshes.
* **Configuration Best Practices:** Meshery helps you assess your configurations against established best practices for Kubernetes and service meshes, ensuring optimal deployment and operation.
* **WebAssembly Filter Management:** Meshery allows you to dynamically load and manage WebAssembly filters for Envoy proxies, enabling advanced traffic management and control.
* **Cloud Native Design Patterns:** Meshery provides access to a catalog of cloud native patterns and a design configurator, simplifying the design and management of your cloud native infrastructure.
* **Unified Policy Engine:** Meshery incorporates a context-aware policy engine based on Open Policy Agent (OPA), allowing you to enforce configuration best practices and custom rules across your environment.

**A Holistic Approach to Cloud Native Management**

Meshery's expanded capabilities make it a comprehensive tool for managing all aspects of your cloud native environment. It empowers you to:

* **Streamline Operations:** Manage the lifecycle, configuration, and performance of service meshes and other cloud native infrastructure components from a single platform.
* **Enhance Collaboration:** Facilitate collaboration among development, operations, and security teams through shared visibility and control.
* **Optimize Performance:** Gain insights into the performance of your applications and infrastructure, identify bottlenecks, and optimize resource utilization.
* **Enforce Best Practices:** Ensure consistent adherence to configuration best practices and security policies across your environment.

**Conclusion**

Meshery has grown beyond its initial focus on service mesh management. It's now a versatile and powerful cloud native manager that provides a holistic approach to managing your entire cloud native infrastructure. By embracing this broader perspective, you can unlock the full potential of Meshery and accelerate your cloud native journey.

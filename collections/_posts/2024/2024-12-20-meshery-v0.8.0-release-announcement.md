We're thrilled to unveil Meshery v0.8.0! This release marks a significant milestone in Meshery's journey, introducing powerful features and enhancements that streamline cloud native infrastructure management.  Since the release of [v0.7.0](/blog/meshery-v07-release-announcement), we've been busy building a more robust, extensible, and user-friendly platform. Here's a glimpse of what's new: We are excited to announce the release of Meshery v0.8.0! This release includes a number of new features and improvements.

## Registry & Models: Enhanced Management and Control

The [Meshery Registry](https://docs.meshery.io/concepts/logical/registry) takes center stage in v0.8.0, acting as the central repository for all capabilities known to Meshery. The registry is where all 320+ Meshery models are imported into each running Meshery deployment. The registry includes models and their components, relationships, connections, credentials, and policies. <img src="/assets/images/posts/2024/2024-03-29-models-designs-legos/five-legos.png" style="float:right; width:50%;" /> 

* **Additional First-Class Constructs:** Whereas [Components](https://docs.meshery.io/concepts/logical/components) were the focal point of how Meshery characterized entities under management, in v0.8.0, [Models](https://docs.meshery.io/concepts/logical/models) and [Relationships](https://docs.meshery.io/concepts/logical/relationships) now have equal treatment among the treated as first-class resources, enabling easier management, versioning, import/export functionality, and their [dynamic generation](https://docs.meshery.io/guides/operating/model-generation).
* **New Model Generators:** Introduced in v0.7.0 timeframe, what were once separate scripts are a collection of reused libraries (yes, coming from [MeshKit](https://layer5.io/blog/meshery/introducing-meshkit-and-the-meshery-adapter-library)) across Meshery Server and notably, within `mesheryctl registry` commands. Enhanced functionality includes model generation direct from GitHub, CSV, Helm repo, Artifact Hub, OCI image, and local file. See [Generating Models](https://docs.meshery.io/guides/configuration-management/generating-models) to learn more.
* **SelectorSets for Relationships:** [SelectorSets](https://docs.meshery.io/concepts/logical/relationships#selectors-in-relationships) allow you to define complex relationships between components with greater precision.

### OCI Support: Streamlined Packaging and Distribution

Meshery v0.8.0 embraces Open Container Image (OCI) as the standard format for packaging and distributing Meshery [Designs](https://docs.meshery.io/concepts/logical/designs) and [Models](https://docs.meshery.io/concepts/logical/models). This ensures seamless sharing and integration across the ecosystem.

* **Publish and Share:** Import and export Meshery models using Meshery's UI, CLI, or ReST API. Push and pull models and designs from OCI registries, including AWS ECR, GitHub Registry, and Docker Hub.
  
## Spaces: Organize and Collaborate

</a>

[Environments](https://docs.meshery.io/concepts/logical/environments) - Group your deployment targets (on-premises servers or cloud services) into logical environments for better organization.
[Workspaces](https://docs.meshery.io/concepts/logical/workspaces) - Boost team collaboration with dedicated workspaces, facilitating shared management and configuration of cloud native infrastructure.

## Extensibility & Extensions: Expanding the Meshery Ecosystem

[Helm Kanvas Snapshot](/extensions/helm-kanvas-snapshot) - Helm Kanvas Snapshot is a Helm chart that allows you to take snapshots of your Kubernetes resources and sync them with Meshery Server. This extension makes it easier to manage and track changes to resources over time.

Looking ahead, additional extensions are planned for v0.9, including [kubectl MeshSync Snapshot](/extensions/kubectl-meshsync-snapshot) and [kubectl Kanvas Snapshot](/extensions/kubectl-kanvas-snapshot). These extensions will allow users to take snapshots of their Kubernetes resources and sync them with Meshery Server. This will make it easier to manage and track changes to resources over time.

## Meshery Catalog: Discover and Share

<img src="/assets/images/posts/2024/2024-02-17-simplifying-cloud-infrastructure-and-kubernetes-management/meshery-catalog.png" width="100%" />

Meshery Catalog functions much like a cloud marketplace, providing a user-friendly interface for browsing, discovering, and sharing configurations and patterns for cloud native infrastructure. In v0.8, Meshery Catalog expands its capabilities with user-defined models, robust filters, and Artifact Hub integration.

* **Contributed Models:** Learn how to share your [models with the community](/blog/share-your-meshery-models) and discover new ones.
* **Artifact Hub Integration:** Browse and publish Meshery Designs on Artifact Hub, expanding the reach and accessibility of reusable configurations.

<a href="https://artifacthub.io" target="_blank"><img alt="Artifact Hub Kinds" src="/assets/images/posts/2024/2024-04-09-designs-on-artifacthub/meshery-designs-on-artifact-hub.png" width="50%" align="right" /></a>

Browse the [catalog](/catalog) or learn more about [how it works](https://docs.meshery.io/concepts/catalog).

You can now browse Meshery Designs in the [Artifact Hub search](https://artifacthub.io/packages/search?kind=24&sort=relevance&page=1). An integration with Artifact Hub is delivered in this release, allowing you to [publish your Meshery Designs to the Artifact Hub](https://deploy-preview-1990--mesheryio-preview.netlify.app/blog/designs-on-artifact-hub), a community-driven catalog of Kubernetes applications with [over 200 Meshery designs](/blog/200-meshery-designs-on-artifacthub) to date and more on the way.

### UI: A Fresh, Modern Look

The Meshery UI receives a major refresh with the adoption of the [Sistent design system](https://layer5.io/projects/sistent) and an in-progress migration to Material UI v5.

* **Enhanced User Experience:** Enjoy a more intuitive and visually appealing interface.
* **New Components:** Leverage a wide range of new components from the Sistent design system.

### CLI: Increased Coverage and Functionality

The Meshery CLI boasts increased code coverage and a full deprecation of Apps and migration to Designs as well as dedicated commands for managing models, relationships, components, connections, credentials, and policies. See all the [CLI commands](https://docs.meshery.io/reference/mesheryctl) in the Meshery documentation.

The Meshery platform is designed to be extensible and flexible, allowing developers to customize and tailor the platform to their specific needs. This flexibility is achieved through the use of a plugin architecture that enables developers to extend Meshery's functionality by adding new features and capabilities. Meshery's plugin architecture is based on the [Operator Pattern](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/), which is a Kubernetes-native approach to managing complex applications. The Operator Pattern provides a declarative way to manage applications and their dependencies, making it easier for developers to build and deploy applications on Kubernetes.

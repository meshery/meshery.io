We're thrilled to share some incredible news that speaks volumes about the power of our community and the impact of Meshery. According to the latest [CNCF Project Velocity Report](https://www.cncf.io/blog/2025/01/29/2024-year-in-review-of-cncf-and-top-30-open-source-project-velocity), Meshery has been recognized as the **9th highest velocity project** among the 200+ projects within the Cloud Native Computing Foundation!

**Speeding Through the Ranks**

It's truly impressive that Meshery, still in its Sandbox stage, has achieved such a high velocity ranking. This accomplishment underscores the project's robust community, active development, and the immense value it brings to the cloud-native ecosystem. Meshery's journey has been one of consistent growth and acceleration. As seen in the "Meshery Project Velocity" slide from the Meshery Incubation Proposal, its position relative to other projects has steadily climbed:

<!-- * 1/1/2020 - 1/1/2021: 33rd position
* 1/1/2021 - 1/1/2022: 31st position
* 1/1/2022 - 1/1/2023: 19th position
* 1/1/2023 - 1/1/2024: 10th position
* 1/1/2024 - 1/1/2025: 9th position 
* * **2025-mid-2025:** 6th highest velocity! -->
  
* **2020-2021:** 33rd highest velocity
* **2021-2022:** 31st highest velocity
* **2022-2023:** 19th highest velocity
* **2023-2024:** 10th highest velocity
* **2024-2025:** 9th highest velocity!

This trajectory demonstrates Meshery's increasing momentum and the growing recognition of its importance within the cloud-native space. This achievement is particularly remarkable considering Meshery is still in the CNCF Sandbox. Ranking so highly against established graduated and incubating projects is a testament to the sheer momentum and dedication behind Meshery.

This isn't an overnight success story. Meshery's velocity has been on a consistent upward trend for years, reflecting its growing adoption and the continuous efforts of its contributors.

This sustained growth underscores the project's vitality and increasing relevance in the cloud-native ecosystem.

## Introduction

Designers and operators often start with visuals before they write manifests. Meshery helps teams keep those diagrams truthful by pairing visual design with the models that underpin real infrastructure. To support teams building on Exoscale, the community has added an "Exoscale Icons" custom model, making it easier to diagram solutions and keep them aligned with the platform you run.

## Meshery model extensibility

Meshery models are intentionally extensible so you can represent the platforms and services you rely on—not just the ones that ship out of the box. Custom models let you bring your own component catalog, naming, and icons, and Meshery keeps those visuals tied to living configurations. That means your diagrams can include Exoscale alongside Kubernetes, databases, and services already in your workspace. Because models are first-class, the same definitions that drive your diagrams can also be used to validate designs, share patterns, and collaborate with teammates without drift.

## Exoscale icons in Meshery designs

The Exoscale icon set slots into Meshery Designs so you can lay out virtual machines, networking, storage, and managed services using symbols your team recognizes. Use it to sketch cloud landing zones, application topologies, or migration plans while staying consistent with Exoscale service names. Teams can combine Exoscale components with other providers in a single diagram, capture relationships, and export artifacts that stay accurate over time. This helps with architecture reviews, onboarding, and documentation—your visuals match what is deployed.

## Learn more about Exoscale

Exoscale is a European cloud provider offering compute, storage, networking, and managed services. If you are new to their platform, the Exoscale Academy provides guided material on getting started and designing reliable workloads. Exploring those resources alongside Meshery Designs can help keep your architecture diagrams and platform knowledge in sync.

## Conclusion

The new Exoscale Icons model is a small but useful addition to Meshery’s library of extensible models. It lets teams diagram solutions with the symbols they already use, while keeping visuals connected to real infrastructure definitions. Try the model in your next Meshery Design and keep your Exoscale diagrams current as your architecture evolves.

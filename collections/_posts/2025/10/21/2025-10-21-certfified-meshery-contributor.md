**Scores needed to pass exams**

All exam scores are reported on a percentage basis, with a passing threshold of 70% or greater. Exams vary in the number, type, and complexity of questions.

Unless specified otherwise, each question holds equal value (typically two points). Passing is determined by demonstrating the requisite knowledge, skills, and competence, considering question difficulty.

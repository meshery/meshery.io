## Certifications

Each Meshery certification is meticulously designed to validate specific levels of expertise within the cloud-native ecosystem, with a keen focus on the Meshery platform.

**Scores needed to pass exams**

All exam scores are reported on a percentage basis, with a passing threshold of 70% or greater. Exams vary in the number, type, and complexity of questions. While questions may be uniformly weighted, they can also differ in point value based on difficulty, as determined by exam creators. Unless specified otherwise, each question holds equal value (typically two points). Passing is determined by demonstrating the requisite knowledge, skills, and competence, considering question difficulty.

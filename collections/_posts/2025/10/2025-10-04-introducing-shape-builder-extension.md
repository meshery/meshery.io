Meshery is proud to announce the release of the Shape Builder extension—a powerful tool that allows you to create custom polygon shapes to visually design and manage your cloud native infrastructure. This extension further enriches the Meshery platform, empowering users to craft detailed architecture diagrams that are tailored to their unique deployments.

### 1. What is Shape Builder?

Shape Builder is a Meshery extension developed to offer users an intuitive interface to build complex polygon shapes that represent components and relationships within your service mesh environment. Visualizing infrastructures is key to understanding and managing distributed systems, and Shape Builder delivers this capability directly in Meshery’s UI.

### 2. Features Overview

- **Custom Polygon Creation:** Draw and modify unique polygon shapes to encapsulate services or infrastructure components.
- **Component Grouping:** Organize related Meshery components visually with easy drag-and-drop layout support.
- **Seamless Integration:** Works natively within Meshery’s dashboard for instant access with your existing cloud native observability tools.
- **Export & Share:** Export your shapes and diagrams for documentation, presentations, or team collaboration.

### 3. Getting Started

The Shape Builder extension is open source and can be enabled in the Meshery extensions marketplace. To start designing your custom infrastructure shapes, simply install and activate the extension from your Meshery dashboard.

### 4. Why Use Shape Builder?

Visual management is more than aesthetics — it's about clarity in complexity. Whether you’re documenting microservices architecture or mapping dependencies, Shape Builder turns complex topologies into understandable visuals. This reduces operational overhead and speeds up troubleshooting and decision-making.

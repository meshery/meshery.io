Hey Meshery Contributors 👋

As we continue evolving Meshery’s end-to-end (E2E) UI test suite, we wanted to proactively communicate some updates and best practices around these tests.

Our ongoing efforts are focused on **improving visibility, performance, and coverage**, while also **reducing noise** from flaky or unstable test cases. This work is essential to ensure our test suite continues to provide confidence without becoming a blocker to fast iteration.

## Why You Might See Some Test Failures

As we refine and improve the test suite, you may start noticing failures from time to time. Don’t panic—this might actually mean the test is working as intended! 🎉 Here’s what we suggest when this happens:

---

## ✅ Step-by-Step: What to Do if a Test Fails

### 1. Verify Your Changes  
First, double-check that your code changes didn’t break something. If a test is consistently failing after your update, it might be due to a legitimate bug. 🐛 

### 2. Retry the Test Suite  
If the failure seems random or inconsistent, go ahead and retry the test. Sometimes flaky tests just need another shot.

### 3. Still Failing? Let’s Triage Based on Test Type

- **Newly Added Tests**  
  If the test was just added and it’s failing consistently, we can **mark it as unstable** to prevent it from blocking merges. Please **call this out in the Slack channel or during a community meeting**, and we’ll open an issue to track and stabilize it.

- **Existing/Older Tests**  
  If a legacy test fails, but the feature work is critical, we can cautiously proceed with the merge **after creating an issue** to investigate the test.  
  In the meantime, we can **temporarily mark the test as unstable** to reduce noise, but please remember to **flag it in Slack or in a meeting** so we stay on top of it.

## 🧰 Resources for Investigating Failures

Here are some handy tools and references to help you diagnose and debug test failures:

- **📖 UI Test Contribution Guide**
For an in-depth walkthrough of how to contribute UI tests using Playwright, see the [Meshery UI Test Contributing Guide](https://docs.meshery.io/project/contributing/contributing-ui-tests)

- **📊 Latest Test Status Dashboard**  
  [View results from the `master` branch](https://docs.meshery.io/project/contributing/test-status)

- **🎥 Playwright Trace Viewer**  
  You can replay test runs with Playwright’s trace viewer using the GitHub Actions artifact generated during the workflow:

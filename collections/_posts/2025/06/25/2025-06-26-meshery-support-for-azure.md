Heyy Folks!!

Meshery Now Supports Azure: Build, Design, and Deploy with Ease

We’re thrilled to announce that Meshery now supports Azure resources, making it easier than ever to bring your Azure cloud infrastructure into your cloud native workflows. With this new integration, you can design your infrastructure visually in Meshery’s designer and deploy it seamlessly all in one place

## What’s New?


#### 1. Discover and Manage Azure Resources

Meshery can now discover and manage 234 different Azure resources directly from the platform. This expanded support means you can bring a wide variety of Azure services into your workflows, enabling unified management of your entire cloud environment in one place.

#### 2. Visual Infrastructure Design

With Meshery’s intuitive designer, you can visually model your Azure infrastructure. Simply drag and drop Azure resources, create relationships, and watch your architecture come together in real time, no coding required. This makes planning and optimizing your deployments easier and more efficient.

#### 3. Built-In Support for Azure resources connections

Meshery now includes built-in capabilities to support and recognize existing connections among Azure services. Thanks to the smart relationship engine, you can establish and validate connections between Azure components with just a click, ensuring seamless integration and smooth operation.

#### 4. Seamless Deployment

Once your design is ready, deploy your Azure resources directly through Meshery. Meshery integrates with the Azure Service Operator, helping you automate and manage Azure services alongside your other cloud native components effortlessly. This integrated workflow streamlines the process from design to deployment, helping you move faster and reduce manual errors.

**What is Security Slam?**

Security Slam is a hands-on event at KubeCon EU where contributors collaborate directly with project maintainers to tackle a curated backlog of security improvements. It's a focused effort to strengthen open-source projects, and we're [prepared](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15gFHw-A6uOchW-0U54-C6Miwv7sjvHFayynwboZwCbc/edit?usp=sharing) and excited to have Meshery (and you!) be a part of it.

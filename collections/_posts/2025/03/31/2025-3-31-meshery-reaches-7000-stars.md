  “Growth is never by mere chance; it is the result of forces working together.”<br>

In 2019, Meshery started as a bold idea: make cloud native infrastructure easier to adopt, operate, and understand. What began as a single tool for managing cloud native infrastructure has grown into a sprawling ecosystem, shaped by thousands of contributions, countless community conversations, and a relentless pursuit of better developer experiences.

We just hit 7,000 stars on GitHub, and Meshery's community is growing faster than ever. With new features and improvements launching, our mascot, [Five](https://layer5.io/five/vol1/mascot-five-adventure-github-stars.pdf), can barely hold onto his rocketship as he blasts off towards new frontiers.

With each star, we've celebrated not just a number but the steady, collective heartbeat of developers, contributors, and adopters around the world. Over time, we've grown not only in code but also in community, purpose, and impact. We’re not just building open source, we’re reimagining what’s possible in the cloud native world.

### Meet Five, Our Intergalactic Cloud Native Hero

If you haven't met Five yet, he's our adventurous mascot, representing the Meshery community as he traverses through the cloud native universe. [Check out Five's interstellar adventures](https://layer5.io/community/adventures-of-five-and-friends) while he hangs onto his rocket for dear life as Meshery speeds towards new heights.

### Rocket #1: Meshery v0.8.0, A Giant Leap Forward

Meshery v0.8.0 marked a significant moment in our journey, not just for the features introduced but also for how it improved the user experience of managing cloud native infrastructure.

**[Registry](https://docs.meshery.io/concepts/logical/registry) and [Models](https://docs.meshery.io/concepts/logical/models)**: With over 320 models, advanced SelectorSets, and simplified model generation directly from GitHub, CSV files, Artifact Hub, Helm charts, and OCI images, managing cloud native resources has never been easier.

**OCI Support**: Design sharing across teams and registries was streamlined, allowing developers to easily distribute and reuse configurations through Docker Hub, AWS ECR, GitHub Registry, and other channels.

**CLI Upgrades**: With new commands for managing models, relationships, and policies, `mesheryctl` is now more intuitive and powerful than ever, empowering developers to handle complexity with confidence.

### Rocket #2: Meshery Catalog: your Cloud Native Marketplace

<img src="/assets/images/posts/2024-02-17-simplifying-cloud-infrastructure-and-kubernetes-management/meshery-catalog.png" width="100%" />

[Meshery Catalog](https://meshery.io/catalog) is your go-to marketplace for cloud native configurations. With **over 200 ready-to-use designs** and growing, it’s a showcase of real-world configurations, contributed and curated by Meshery users.

From simple setups to more advanced designs, Catalog helps developers skip the YAML struggle and start with something that works.

### Rocket #3: Spaces, Collaborate Like Never Before

Managing infrastructure is rarely a solo job, and with Meshery Spaces, it doesn’t have to feel like one. Spaces helps teams operate smoothly and intuitively, whenever they're deploying or collaborating across the world.

  **[Environments](https://docs.meshery.io/concepts/logical/environments)** helps you group your deployment targets into clearly defined, logical environments, simplifying your deployments and infrastructure management.

  **[Workspaces](https://docs.meshery.io/concepts/logical/workspaces)** let you and your team collaborate in real time, designing and managing infrastructure together, without the back-and-forth of endless files or Slack threads.

### Rocket #4: Improved Developer Experience

We've always believed that great tools should empower, not overwhelm, which is why we put great efforts into refining the experience for every developer, from first-timers to experienced pros.

From guided [tutorials](https://cloud.layer5.io/academy/overview) that walk you through everything, to Playwright-powered testing that brings speed and stability, Meshery continues to make things easier and more reliable for every developer.

### Rocket #5: Community, Our Brightest Star

You, the community, are the real stars here. Every GitHub issue, PR, Slack conversation, and contribution matters. Your contributions keep our rocketship soaring.

With over 20,000 issues addressed and contributions across 100+ repositories, the Meshery community is thriving with activity and continuously evolving. You are our brightest stars.

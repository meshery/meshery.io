Meshery's recognition programs are designed to acknowledge and celebrate the contributions of our community members. These programs provide a way for users and contributors to earn badges that signify their achievements and involvement in the Meshery ecosystem.

#### Partner Programs

The following community partners offer recognition programs in conjunction with Meshery. These programs are designed to recognize and reward contributions to the Meshery project and your participation in the Meshery ecosystem:


- *[Layer5](https://badges.layer5.io)* - Badges are one of the many ways that we recognize the efforts of our contributors and uplift our users. Badges represent milestones that you achieve both in using and in contributing to Meshery. As a contributor, this is how you demonstrate your ownership, dedication, skills and commitment. As a user, this is how you demonstrate your prowess, milestones, and meaningful engagement.

- *[Add your program here](https://github.com/meshery/meshery.io/pulls)* - Add your recognition program to this list by [submitting a pull request](https://github.com/meshery/meshery.io/pulls).

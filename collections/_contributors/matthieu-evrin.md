bio: "Enthusiastic technology lover mainly on opensource technology mainly on Kubernetes and its ecosystem. Always wanted to contribute to open-source but I did not know how and where to start until my first contribution for Meshery. I have a background in several domains related to computer science (networking, linux system admin, java developer, database administrator) and became a Platform Engineer since a while now. I like coding mostly in the backend and in automation. I am always wanting to learn and share with others so you don't hesitate to connect with me on social media."

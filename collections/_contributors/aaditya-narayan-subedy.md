bio: I am a Computer Engineering student, currently studying at Delhi Technological University. Learning about new technologies fascinates me. I try to give my best at whatever I have been assigned to do. Contributing to the Layer5 organization has been an amazing experience. I am not only learning so much here but also getting to interact and share ideas with community members, thus helping me grow as a person too.

          <b>What is Layer5 Community?</b>
        </ol>
        <ol>
          While small, the Layer5 community represents the largest collection of
          service mesh projects and their maintainers in the world. We build
          projects to provide learning environments, deployment and operational
          best practices, performance benchmarks, create documentation, share
          networking opportunities, and more. Our shared commitment to the open
          source spirit pushes Layer5 projects forward. New members are always
          welcome.

      <ul>
        <ol>
          <b>Is it Open Source?</b>
        </ol>
        <ol>
          Layer5 projects are open source software. Anyone can download, use,
          work on, and share it with others. It's built on principles like
          collaboration, globalism, and innovation. Layer5 projects are
          distributed under the terms of Apache v2.

          <b>Google Summer of Code Participation?</b>
        </ol>
        <ol>
          The key component of these projects is our Community. This community,
          which you will join as an participant in Google Summer of Code, is
          improving the world of diverse cloud native systems. Your
          contributions will affect people you've never met. The Layer5
          community includes software engineers, researchers, students, artists,
          system administrators, operators and web designers -- all of whom will
          be happy to help you get started.
        </ol>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <ol>
          We believe that all contributors should expect and be part of a safe
          and friendly environment for constructive contribution. We can more
          effectively and successfully compare and challenge different ideas to
          find the best solutions for advancement, while building the size,
          diversity, and strength of our community.

          <b>SMI Conformance Testing </b>
        </ol>
        <ol>
          <b>Description</b
          >: Ensure that a service mesh is properly configured and that its
          behavior conforms to official SMI specifications. Conformance consists
          of both capabilities and compliance status as outlined in the
          <a

        <ol>
          <b>Distributed Load Testing of Service Meshes</b>
        </ol>
        <ol>
          <b>Description</b
          >: Many performance benchmarks are limited to single instance load
          generation (single pod load generator). This limits the amount of
          traffic that can be generated to output of the single machine that the
          benchmark tool runs on in or out of a cluster. Overcoming this
          limitation would allow for more flexible and robust testing.
          Distributed load testing in parallel poses a challenge when merging
          results without losing the precision we need to gain insight into the
          high tail percentiles. Use Meshery’s interface for supporting
          different load generators (a point of extensibility) to place support
          for Vegeta. Workloads running on service meshes are hit in various
          ways and generally not from the same source. Use of a distributed load
          generator will aid in the testing of service mesh behavior.

          <ol><b>Meshery </b></ol>
          <ol>
            Meshery is the cloud native management plane for lifecycle, configuration and performance management of many
            service meshes.
            See <a href="/">Meshery</a> for more information.

          <ol><b>Linkerd and Envoy </b></ol>
          <ol>Linkerd is an ultralight service mesh for Kubernetes and beyond: <a
              href="https://linkerd.io">https://linkerd.io</a>. Envoy is an open source edge and service proxy, designed
            for cloud-native applications: <a href="https://linkerd.io">https://www.envoyproxy.io</a>.</ol>
        </ul>
        <ul class="project-item">
          <ol><b>Benchmarks for Linkerd and Envoy</b></ol>
          <ol> Description: Linkerd, like other service meshes are plagued by the question of adopters asking the
            question: "what's the performance overhead of the service mesh?".
            Envoy does not publish performance test results <a
              href="https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/faq/performance/how_fast_is_envoy">(see How fast is
              Envoy)</a>. Linkerd, Istio, Envoy and the list of other service meshes don't have a consistent set of
            performance benchmarks between them. So, even if Envoy were to publish performance results, users still
            wouldn't be able to compare overhead between Linkerd and Envoy. The project idea here is to build a multi-mesh
            performance benchmark tool. </ol>

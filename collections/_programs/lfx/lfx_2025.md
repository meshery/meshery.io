          Meshery Models are declarative representations of infrastructure and applications. Within these models, Relationships define how different Components (e.g., Kubernetes resources, Cloud services) interact and depend on each other. These relationships are crucial for visualizing, understanding, and managing complex cloud native systems.

          This internship focuses on significantly expanding the breadth and depth of Meshery Relationships across a wide array of technologies supported by Meshery. As Meshery continues to integrate with more cloud-native technologies (Kubernetes, public clouds, and all CNCF projects), there's a growing need to accurately model the intricate relationships between their components - vital for providing users with comprehensive insights and control over their deployments.

          Meshery integrates with many other CNCF projects and technologies. Sustaining those integrations is only possible through automation. To automate functional integration and end-to-end testing, Meshery now uses Playwright as one of the tools for browser testing. End-to-end tests run with each pull request to ensure that changes do not break existing functionality.

          Expanding the coverage of E2E tests is crucial to improving the reliability of Meshery's UI and workflows. This project focuses on writing Playwright-based tests for more Meshery components, ensuring robust test coverage across the platform.

community_description: |
  The Meshery community embraces developer-defined infrastructure. We empower developers to change how they write applications, support operators in rethinking how they run modern infrastructure, and enable product owners to regain full-control over their product portfolio.

  Our cloud native application and infrastructure management software enables organizations to expect more from their infrastructure. Our inclusive and diverse community stewards projects to provide learning environments, create and implement cloud native industry standards, deployment and operational best practices, benchmarks and abstractions, and more.

  Our pay-it-forward mentality with every contributor (mentee or not) is a shared commitment by all maintainers (and MeshMates - contributor onboarding buddies) to the open source spirit that pushes the project forward. New members are always welcome.

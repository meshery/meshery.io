community_description: |
  The Meshery community embraces developer-defined infrastructure. We empower developers to change how they write applications, support operators in rethinking how they run modern infrastructure, and enable product owners to regain full-control over their product portfolio.

  Our cloud native application and infrastructure management software enables organizations to expect more from their infrastructure. Our inclusive and diverse community stewards projects to provide learning environments, create and implement cloud native industry standards, deployment and operational best practices, benchmarks and abstractions, and more.

  Our pay-it-forward mentality with every contributor (mentee or not) is a shared commitment by all maintainers (and MeshMates - contributor onboarding buddies) to the open source spirit that pushes the project forward. New members are always welcome.

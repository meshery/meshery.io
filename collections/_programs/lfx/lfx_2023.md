          Integrate a new architectural component into Meshery: a workflow engine. This project involves shifting Meshery off of bitcask and off of sqlite over to postgres using gorm (golang). Interns will familiarize with concepts of orchestration engines, including chaining workflows, and content lifecycle management.

          Advance the cloud native playground in which any CNCF project can be explored. Meshery’s genesis is that of helping teach people about cloud native technology and enabling to operate various types of cloud native infrastructure confidently. The proposed project is aimed at furthering this mission by infusing multi-user collaboration as a pervasisve feature so that users can learn together in a running instance of Meshery.

          Meshery's highly dynamic infrastructure configuration capabilities require real-time evaluation of complex policies. Policies of various types and with a high number of parameters need to be evaluated client-side. With policies expressed in Rego, the goal of this project is to incorporate use of the https://github.com/open-policy-agent/golang-opa-wasm project into Meshery UI, so that a powerful, real-time user experience is possible.

        description: |
          The adaptive load controller is to execute optimization routines recursively to determine the maximum load a system can sustain. The maximum load is usually defined by the maximum requests per second (rps) the system can handle. The metrics (CPU usage, latency etc) collected from the system under test are the constraints we provide to judge whether a system under test (SUT) is sustaining the load.

          A use-case that fits very well is be the ability to use it to run performance tests on a schedule and track the maximum load a system can handle over time. This could give insights to performance improvements or degradations.

          Meshery UI lacks a permissions framework. The existing internal implementation is simple, fragile and must be completely rewritten. The approach to implemention a permmissions framework includes using React.js and CASL.js. Meshery UI's approach needs to be extensible given that this framework will be an extension point for Remote Providers to supply their own permissions.

Each key is then put into a group of keys in a keychain, keychains assigned to user roles, in turn, roles assigned to users. With users having the ability to create own custom roles, the framework will be dynamic based on the associated server-side permissions for the currently auth’ed user."

This information can be used to provide syntax highlighting and auto-completion for these definitions in the JSON files, making it easier for developers to write error-free code."
          - "Stretch Goal: OCI image signing; Verify the authenticity of MeshModels using cosign"
          - "Validation and Reference: For Meshery MeshModel definitions such as cloud-native components and their relationships, the plugin can use the CUE language to provide validation for the CUE input and preview the rendering result. The plugin can also fetch the SMP Model schemas and display them in the IDE for reference."

  Previous experience with technical writers or documentation
  Our mentors have managed teams of technical writers working on documenting enterprise-grade software at large technology companies (Cisco, Seagate, SolarWinds). During the span of time, they have worked with technical writers in DITA and post-DITA environments (from Word to FrameMaker, structured writing, online help, various CMSes, git). Our mentors have worked with technical writers on documentation strategy, creating document sets, covering the full spectrum of reader personas.
  We interact daily over Slack, and have an open source project meeting everyday, which are posted to the community YouTube channel.

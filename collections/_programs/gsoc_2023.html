        </ol>
        <ol>
          The Layer5 community represents the largest collection of cloud native
          management integrations. We build projects to provide learning
          environments, deployment and operational best practices, performance
          benchmarks, create documentation, share networking opportunities, and
          more. Our shared commitment to the open source spirit pushes Layer5
          projects forward. New members are always welcome.

          <p class="sub_headings">Is it Open Source?</p>
        </ol>
        <ol>
          Layer5 projects are open source software. Anyone can download, use,
          work on, and share it with others. It's built on principles like
          collaboration, globalism, and innovation. Layer5 projects are
          distributed under the terms of Apache v2.

        </ol>
        <ol>
          The key component of these projects is our Community. This community,
          which you will join as an participant in Google Summer of Code, is
          improving the world of diverse cloud native systems. Your
          contributions will affect people you've never met. The Layer5
          community includes software engineers, researchers, students, artists,
          system administrators, operators and web designers -- all of whom will
          be happy to help you get started.
        </ol>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <ol>
          We believe that all contributors should expect and be part of a safe
          and friendly environment for constructive contribution. We can more
          effectively and successfully compare and challenge different ideas to
          find the best solutions for advancement, while building the size,
          diversity, and strength of our community.

          <p class="sub_headings">In-browser OPA policy evaluation in WASM and Rego</p>
        </ol>
        <ol>
          <p class="sub_headings">Description:</p>
          Meshery's highly dynamic infrastructure configuration capabilities require real-time evaluation of complex policies. Policies of various types and with a high number of parameters need to be evaluted client-side. With policies expressed in Rego, the goal of this project is to incorporate use of the https://github.com/open-policy-agent/golang-opa-wasm project into Meshery UI, so that a powerful, real-time user experience is possible.

        <ol>
          <p class="sub_headings">Description:</p>
          Network topologies and graph databases go hand-in-hand. The OpenAPI specifications for Kubernetes provides taxonomy, but augmenting a graph data model with formalized ontologies enables any number of capabilities, one of the more straightforward is the inferencing requisite for natural language processing, and consequently, a human-centric query / response interaction becomes becomes possible. More importantly, more advanced systems can be built when a graph data model of connected systems is upgraded to be a knowledge semantic graph.

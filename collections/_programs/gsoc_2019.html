        <ol><b>What is Layer5 Community?</b></ol>
        <ol>Layer5 community represents the largest collection of cloud native  management integrations in the world. We build projects to provide learning environments, deployment and operational best
          practices, performance benchmarks, create documentation, share networking opportunities, and more. Our shared
          commitment to the open source spirit pushes Layer5 projects forward. New members are always welcome.
        </ol>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <ol><b>Is it Open Source?</b></ol>
        <ol> Layer5 projects are open source software. Anyone can download, use, work on, and share it with others. It's
          built on principles like collaboration, globalism, and innovation. Layer5 projects are distributed under the
          terms of Apache v2. </ol>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <ol><b>Google Summer of Code Participation?</b></ol>
        <ol> The key component of these projects is our Community. This community, which you will join as an participant
          in Google Summer of Code, is improving the world of diverse cloud native systems. Your contributions will
          affect people you've never met. The Layer5 community includes software engineers, researchers, students,
          artists, system administrators, operators and web designers -- all of whom will be happy to help you get
          started.
        </ol>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <ol>We believe that all contributors should expect and be part of a safe and friendly environment for
          constructive contribution. We can more effectively and successfully compare and challenge different ideas to
          find the best solutions for advancement, while building the size, diversity, and strength of our community.
        </ol>

      <h5 class="black-text heading"> Project Ideas </h5>
      <ul class="project-item">
        <ol><b>Meshery </b></ol>
        <ol>
          Meshery is the cloud native manager for lifecycle, configuration and performance management of Kuberentes clusters and any workload.
          See <a href="/">Meshery</a> for more information.
        </ol>
      </ul>
      <ul class="project-item">
        <ol><b>Linkerd and Envoy </b></ol>
        <ol>Linkerd is an ultralight service mesh for Kubernetes and beyond: <a
            href="https://linkerd.io">https://linkerd.io</a>. Envoy is an open source edge and service proxy, designed
          for cloud-native applications: <a href="https://linkerd.io">https://www.envoyproxy.io</a>.</ol>
      </ul>
      <ul class="project-item">
        <ol><b>Benchmarks for Linkerd and Envoy</b></ol>
        <ol> Description: Linkerd, like other service meshes are plagued by the question of adopters asking the
          question: "what's the performance overhead of the service mesh?".
          Envoy does not publish performance test results <a
            href="https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/faq/performance/how_fast_is_envoy">(see How fast is
            Envoy)</a>. Linkerd, Istio, Envoy and the list of other service meshes don't have a consistent set of
          performance benchmarks between them. So, even if Envoy were to publish performance results, users still
          wouldn't be able to compare overhead between Linkerd and Envoy. The project idea here is to build a multi-mesh
          performance benchmark tool. </ol>

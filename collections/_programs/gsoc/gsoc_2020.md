subtitle: "Meshery participation for 2020"

description: |
  The Meshery community represents the largest collection of cloud native management integrations.
  We build projects to provide learning environments, deployment and operational best practices,
  performance benchmarks, create documentation, share networking opportunities, and more.
  Our shared commitment to the open source spirit pushes Meshery projects forward. New members are always welcome.
  Meshery projects are open source software. Anyone can download, use, work on, and share it with others.
  It's built on principles like collaboration, globalism, and innovation. Meshery projects are distributed under the terms of Apache v2.
  The key component of these projects is our Community. This community, which you will join as a participant in Google Summer of Code,
  is improving the world of diverse cloud native systems. Your contributions will affect people you've never met.
  The Meshery community includes software engineers, researchers, students, artists, system administrators, operators and web designers — all of whom
  will be happy to help you get started.
  We believe that all contributors should expect and be part of a safe and friendly environment for constructive contribution.

  - title: "Project 1: SMI Conformance Testing"
    description: |
      Ensure that a service mesh is properly configured and that its behavior conforms to official SMI specifications.
      Conformance consists of both capabilities and compliance status as outlined in the
      [design specification](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HL8Sk7NSLLj-9PRqoHYVIGyU6fZxUQFotrxbmfFtjwc/edit).
    outcomes:
      - "Automated framework to test conformance of service meshes to the SMI spec."
      - "Published results of SMI capability and compliance checks."
    skills: "Golang, Kubernetes"
    size: "medium (~175 hour project)"

  - title: "Project 2: Distributed Load Testing of Service Meshes"
    description: |
      Many performance benchmarks are limited to single instance load generation (single pod load generator).
      This limits the amount of traffic that can be generated to the output of a single machine running in or out of a cluster.
      Overcoming this limitation would allow for more flexible and robust testing.
      Distributed load testing in parallel poses a challenge when merging results without losing the precision needed
      to gain insight into the high tail percentiles. Use Meshery’s interface for supporting different load generators
      (a point of extensibility) to place support for Vegeta.
      Use of a distributed load generator will aid in the testing of service mesh behavior under real-world conditions.
    outcomes:
      - "Support for distributed load testing via Meshery’s extensibility interface."
      - "Insights into real-world service mesh performance using Vegeta."

community_what: >
  The Layer5 community represents the largest collection of cloud native management integrations.
  We build projects to provide learning environments, deployment and operational best practices,
  performance benchmarks, create documentation, share networking opportunities, and more.
  Our shared commitment to the open source spirit pushes Layer5 projects forward. New members are always welcome.

community_open_source: >
  Layer5 projects are open source software. Anyone can download, use, work on, and share it with others.
  It's built on principles like collaboration, globalism, and innovation. Layer5 projects are distributed under the terms of Apache v2.

community_gsoc_participation: >
  The key component of these projects is our Community. This community, which you will join as a participant in Google Summer of Code,
  is improving the world of diverse cloud native systems. Your contributions will affect people you've never met.
  The Layer5 community includes software engineers, researchers, students, artists, system administrators, operators and web designers — all of whom
  will be happy to help you get started.

community_belief: >
  We believe that all contributors should expect and be part of a safe and friendly environment for constructive contribution.
  We can more effectively and successfully compare and challenge different ideas to find the best solutions for advancement,
  while building the size, diversity, and strength of our community.

projects:
  - name: "SMI Conformance Testing"
    description: >
      Ensure that a service mesh is properly configured and that its behavior conforms to official SMI specifications.
      Conformance consists of both capabilities and compliance status as outlined in the
      [design specification](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HL8Sk7NSLLj-9PRqoHYVIGyU6fZxUQFotrxbmfFtjwc/edit).

  - name: "Distributed Load Testing of Service Meshes"
    description: >
      Many performance benchmarks are limited to single instance load generation (single pod load generator).
      This limits the amount of traffic that can be generated to the output of a single machine running in or out of a cluster.
      Overcoming this limitation would allow for more flexible and robust testing.
      Distributed load testing in parallel poses a challenge when merging results without losing the precision needed
      to gain insight into the high tail percentiles. Use Meshery’s interface for supporting different load generators
      (a point of extensibility) to place support for Vegeta.
      Workloads running on service meshes are hit in various ways and generally not from the same source.
      Use of a distributed load generator will aid in the testing of service mesh behavior.

community_what: >
  Layer5 community represents the largest collection of cloud native management integrations in the world.
  We build projects to provide learning environments, deployment and operational best practices, performance benchmarks,
  create documentation, share networking opportunities, and more. Our shared commitment to the open source spirit pushes
  Layer5 projects forward. New members are always welcome.
community_open_source: >
  Layer5 projects are open source software. Anyone can download, use, work on, and share it with others.
  It's built on principles like collaboration, globalism, and innovation. Layer5 projects are distributed under the terms of Apache v2.
community_gsoc_participation: >
  The key component of these projects is our Community. This community, which you will join as a participant in Google Summer of Code,
  is improving the world of diverse cloud native systems. Your contributions will affect people you've never met.
  The Layer5 community includes software engineers, researchers, students, artists, system administrators, operators and web designers — all of whom
  will be happy to help you get started.
community_belief: >
  We believe that all contributors should expect and be part of a safe and friendly environment for constructive contribution.
  We can more effectively and successfully compare and challenge different ideas to find the best solutions for advancement,
  while building the size, diversity, and strength of our community.

projects:
  - name: "Meshery"
    description: >
      Meshery is the cloud native manager for lifecycle, configuration and performance management of Kubernetes clusters and any workload.
      See [Meshery](/) for more information.
  - name: "Linkerd and Envoy"
    description: >
      Linkerd is an ultralight service mesh for Kubernetes and beyond: [Linkerd](https://linkerd.io). Envoy is an open source edge and service proxy,
      designed for cloud-native applications: [Envoy](https://www.envoyproxy.io).
  - name: "Benchmarks for Linkerd and Envoy"
    description: >
      Description: Linkerd, like other service meshes, is plagued by the question of adopters asking: "what's the performance overhead of the service mesh?".
      Envoy does not publish performance test results (see [How fast is Envoy](https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/faq/performance/how_fast_is_envoy)).
      Linkerd, Istio, Envoy and other service meshes lack a consistent set of performance benchmarks. Even if Envoy were to publish performance results,
      users still wouldn't be able to compare overhead between Linkerd and Envoy. The project idea here is to build a multi-mesh performance benchmark tool.

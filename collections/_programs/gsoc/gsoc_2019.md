subtitle: "Meshery participation for 2019"

description: |
  Meshery community represents the largest collection of cloud native management integrations in the world.
  We build projects to provide learning environments, deployment and operational best practices, performance benchmarks,
  create documentation, share networking opportunities, and more.  Our shared commitment to the open source spirit pushes Meshery projects forward. New members are always welcome.
  Meshery projects are open source software. Anyone can download, use, work on, and share it with others.
  It's built on principles like collaboration, globalism, and innovation. Meshery projects are distributed under the terms of Apache v2.
  The key component of these projects is our Community. This community, which you will join as a participant in Google Summer of Code,
  is improving the world of diverse cloud native systems. Your contributions will affect people you've never met.  The Meshery community includes software engineers, researchers, students, artists, system administrators, operators and web designers â€” all of whom
  will be happy to help you get started.
  We believe that all contributors should expect and be part of a safe and friendly environment for constructive contribution.

  - title: "Project 1: Meshery"
    description: |
      Meshery is the cloud native manager for lifecycle, configuration and performance management of Kubernetes clusters and any workload.
      See [Meshery](/) for more information.
    outcomes:
      - "Improved lifecycle management for Kubernetes workloads."
      - "Implementation of Meshery's performance benchmarking system."
    skills: "Golang, JavaScript, Kubernetes"
    size: "large (~350 hour project)"
    mentors:
      - name: "Lee Calcote"

    issue: "https://github.com/meshery/meshery/issues"

  - title: "Project 2: Linkerd and Envoy"
    description: |
      Linkerd is an ultralight service mesh for Kubernetes and beyond: [Linkerd](https://linkerd.io). Envoy is an open source edge and service proxy,
      designed for cloud-native applications: [Envoy](https://www.envoyproxy.io).
    outcomes:
      - "Evaluated capabilities of Linkerd and Envoy as Meshery integrations."
      - "Support for each within Meshery's model representation."
    skills: "Golang, JavaScript, Kubernetes"
    size: "medium (~175 hour project)"

  - title: "Project 3: Benchmarks for Linkerd and Envoy"
    description: |
      Linkerd, like other service meshes, is plagued by the question of adopters asking: "what's the performance overhead of the service mesh?".
      Envoy does not publish performance test results (see [How fast is Envoy](https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/faq/performance/how_fast_is_envoy)).
      This project will build a multi-mesh performance benchmarking tool for comparing Linkerd, Envoy, and other service meshes.
    outcomes:
      - "Creation of a benchmark tool to evaluate and compare performance across service meshes."
      - "Published results on service mesh overhead, focusing on Linkerd and Envoy."
    skills: "Golang, JavaScript, Kubernetes"

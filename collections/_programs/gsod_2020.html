        </ol>
        <ol>
          While small, the Layer5 community represents the largest collection of
          service mesh projects and their maintainers in the world. We build
          projects to provide learning environments, deployment and operational
          best practices, performance benchmarks, create documentation, share
          networking opportunities, and more. Our shared commitment to the open
          source spirit pushes Layer5 projects forward. New members are always
          welcome.

          <p class="sub_headings">Is it Open Source?</p>
        </ol>
        <ol>
          Layer5 projects are open source software. Anyone can download, use,
          work on, and share it with others. It's built on principles like
          collaboration, globalism, and innovation. Layer5 projects are
          distributed under the terms of Apache v2.

          gives technical writers an opportunity to work with open source
          projects. Layer5 is participating in the Season of Docs in 2020. See

      <h3 class="black-text heading">Project Ideas</h3>
      <p class="program-p">
        The following is a list of project ideas for Layer5's participation in
        Google Season of Docs.
      </p>

      <dl class="project-item">
        <h4 class="project-list">Goal: Create the world’s service mesh playground.</h4>
        <dt class="subhead">Meshery’s genesis is that of helping teach people about service mesh technology and enabling
          to operate this type of cloud native infrastructure confidently. The proposed project is aimed at furthering
          this mission with interactive API documentation connected to a service mesh learning playground (a running
          instance of Meshery). This project sits squarely in the crosshairs of our purpose - both for Meshery and
          Layer5.

          <h4 class="project-list project-list-heading">The project’s scope</h4>
        <dt class="subhead">User Tutorials</dt>
        <dd class="dd-content">We will create a new set of interactive documentation for Meshery users to both learn how to use Meshery,
          but also confidently adopt and operate any service mesh. We have a number of community volunteers lined up and
          committed to collaboration on the creation of this service mesh playground. The technical writer will
          collaborate with other engineers, working with Swagger and Docusaurus.
        </dd>

        <dl class="project-item">
          <dt class="subhead">Work that is out-of-scope for this project:</dt>
          <dd>
            - Creation of the Open API specification for Meshery
          </dd>
          <dd>
            - Deployment of Docusarous
          </dd>
          <dd>
            - Visual design of the site
          </dd>
        </dl>
        <h4 class="project-list">We will bring support from the Meshery CI WG, provide a full-time visual and user
          experience designer and well as three dedicated core maintainers of Meshery. We have one strong technical
          writing candidate for this project, and estimate that this work will take six months to complete. We will
          support this technical writer and prioritize any dependencies on the project or community that they may have.
        </h4>
        <h4 class="project-list">Measuring project success</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>To measure success, we will track:</li>
          <li>The number of new API playground users (quantitative - tracked by the system)</li>
          <li>The number of repeat visits of the same users (quantitative - tracked by the system)</li>
          <li>The number of failed attempts to invoke an API (signifies poor documentation) (quantitative - tracked by
            the system)</li>
          <li>Feedback from users on how intuitive the documentation is (qualitative - tracked through user polls)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We would consider the project successful if, after publication of the new API documentation</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The total count of performance tests run by Meshery increases by 10% (see the current count on
            https://meshery.io)</li>
          <li>The new number of new Meshery users increases by 20% (currently at ~1,000 users)</li>
        </ul>

        <ol><b>What is Layer5 Community?</b></ol>
        <ol>The Layer5 community represents the largest collection of cloud native management integrations. We build projects to provide learning environments, deployment and operational best
          practices, performance benchmarks, create documentation, share networking opportunities, and more. Our shared
          commitment to the open source spirit pushes Layer5 projects forward. New members are always welcome.
        </ol>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <ol><b>Is it Open Source?</b></ol>
        <ol> Layer5 projects are open source software. Anyone can download, use, work on, and share it with others. It's
          built on principles like collaboration, globalism, and innovation. Layer5 projects are distributed under the
          terms of Apache v2. </ol>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <ol><b>Community Bridge </b></ol>
        <ol> The Linux Foundation's <a href="https://lfx.org">LFX</a> is building a healthy ecosystem around the open source software by funding projects, securing code, and connecting with talented developers. Layer5 is participating in the LFX's mentorship program every quarter.
        </ol>

      <h5 class="black-text heading"> Project Idea </h5>
      <ul class="project-item">
        <ol><b>Service Mesh Interface Conformance Testing </b></ol>

        <ol> Ensure that a service mesh is properly configured and that its behavior conforms to official SMI
          specifications.
          Conformance consists of both capabilities and compliance status as outlined in the design specification.

          Meshery is the open source, cloud native management plane that enables the adoption, operation, and management of Kubernetes, any service mesh, and their workloads.
        </ol>

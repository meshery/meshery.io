        <p class="sub-headings">About Layer5 and its projects</p>
        The Layer5 community embraces developer-defined infrastructure. We empower developers to change how they write
        applications, support operators in rethinking how they run modern infrastructure, and enable product owners to
        regain full-control over their product portfolio. Our cloud native application and infrastructure management
        software enables organizations to expect more from their infrastructure.
        Our inclusive and diverse community stewards projects to provide learning environments, create and implement
        cloud native industry standards, deployment and operational best practices, benchmarks and abstractions, and
        more. Our pay-it-forward mentality with every contributor (mentee or not) is a shared commitment by all
        maintainers (and MeshMates - contributor onboarding buddies) to the open source spirit that pushes Layer5
        projects like Meshery forward. New members are always welcome.
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <p class="sub-headings">Additional information</p>
        Previous experience with technical writers or documentation
        Our mentors have managed teams of technical writers working on documenting enterprise-grade software at large
        technology companies (Cisco, Seagate, SolarWinds). During the span of time, they have worked with technical
        writers in DITA and post-DITA environments (from Word to FrameMaker, structured writing, online help, various
        CMSes, git). Our mentors have worked with technical writers on documentation strategy, creating document sets,
        covering the full spectrum of reader personas.
        We interact daily over Slack, and have an open source project meeting everyday, which are posted to the
        community YouTube channel.

          <h4 class="sub_headings">Adaptive Load Controller II</h4>
          Description: The adaptive load controller is to execute optimization routines recursivley to determine the
          maximum load a system can sustain. The maximum load is usually defined by the maximum requests per second
          (rps) the system can handle. The metrics (CPU usage, latency etc) collected from the system under test are the
          constraints we provide to judge whether a system under test (SUT) is sustaining the load.

          A use-case that fits very well is be the ability to use it to run performance tests on a schedule and track
          the maximum load a system can handle over time. This could give insights to performance improvements or
          degradations.

          Description: Network topologies and graph databases go hand-in-hand. The OpenAPI specifications for Kubernetes
          provides taxonomy, but augmenting a graph data model with formalized ontologies enables any number of
          capabilities, one of the more straightforward is the inferencing requisite for natural language processing,
          and consequently, a human-centric query / response interaction becomes becomes possible. More importantly,
          more advanced systems can be built when a graph data model of connected systems is upgraded to be a knowledge

            Description: Meshery UI lacks a permissions framework. The existing internal implementation is simple,
            fragile and must be completely rewritten. The approach to implemention a permmissions framework includes
            using React.js and CASL.js. Meshery UI's approach needs to be extensible given that this framework will be
            an extension point for Remote Providers to supply their own permissions.

          <ol>
            <p class="sub_headings">Expected Outcome</p>
            Definition of permissions and their enforcement in Meshery with an aim for deep granularity and
            extensibility with each user interface input component carrying a unique permission key id. Each key is then
            put into a group of keys in a keychain, keychains assigned to user roles, in turn, roles assigned to users.
            With users having the ability to create own custom roles, the framework will be dynamic based on the
            associated server-side permissions for the currently auth’ed user.

                  Network topologies and graph databases go hand-in-hand. The OpenAPI specifications for Kubernetes
                  provides taxonomy, but augmenting a graph data model with formalized ontologies enables any number of
                  capabilities, one of the more straightforward is the inferencing requisite for natural language
                  processing, and consequently, a human-centric query / response interaction becomes becomes possible.
                  More importantly, more advanced systems can be built when a graph data model of connected systems is
                  upgraded to be a knowledge semantic graph. Deliverables (among other items):

                  <p class="sub_headings">Description:</p>
                  The objective of this project is to develop IDE plugins that can enhance the developer experience
                  while working with Service Mesh Performance Performance Profiles. The proposed plugins will leverage
                  technologies such as golang and cuelang to provide features such as syntax highlighting,
                  auto-completion, validation, and rendering previews for Service Mesh Performance profile and model
                  definitions.

                  <li>Release VS Code Extension</li>
                  <li>Syntax Highlighting and Auto-completion: The plugin can fetch SMP Model definitions such as
                    cloud-native components and their relationships. This information can be used to provide syntax
                    highlighting and auto-completion for these definitions in the JSON files, making it easier for
                    developers to write error-free code.</li>
                  <li>Stretch Goal: OCI image signing; Verify the authenticity of MeshModels using cosign</li>
                  <li>Validation and Reference: For Meshery MeshModel definitions such as cloud-native components and
                    their relationships, the plugin can use the CUE language to provide validation for the CUE input and
                    preview the rendering result. The plugin can also fetch the SMP Model schemas and display them in
                    the IDE for reference.</li>

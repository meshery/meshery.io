        </ol>
        <ol>
          The Meshery community represents the largest collection of
          cloud native management integrations. We build
          projects to provide learning environments, deployment and operational
          best practices, performance benchmarks, create documentation, share
          networking opportunities, and more. Our shared commitment to the open
          source spirit pushes Meshery projects forward. New members are always
          welcome.

        </ol>
        <ol>
          Meshery projects are open source software. Anyone can download, use,
          work on, and share it with others. It's built on principles like
          collaboration, globalism, and innovation. Meshery projects are
          distributed under the terms of Apache v2.

          The Major League Hacking's
          <a href="https://fellowship.mlh.io/">[MLH Fellowship]</a>
          is an internship alternative for software engineers. Instead of
          working on a project for just one company, you'll contribute to Open
          Source projects that are used by companies around the world. You'll
          collaborate with a group of 10 students under the guidance of a
          professional mentor whose only job is to help you successfully
          contribute.

## Membership Requirements

Contributors may be invited typically:

- Have been actively involved in the community for several weeks
- Make regular updates to projects
- Help other community members
- Attend development meetings
- Demonstrate a willingness to learn and share knowledge
- Show a genuine desire to improve themselves, others, and the projects

## Invitation Process (for Maintainers)

Depending on the number and quality of contributions across the five Meshery GitHub organizations, contributors may receive an invitation to one or more of these organizations.

The process includes:

1. Sending a group direct message (DM)
2. Executing a Slack slash command in the `#community-management` channel

---

## Group Message for Invitations

When identifying a worthy contributor, initiate a group DM with the contributor and relevant maintainers or project leads. Highlight the individualâ€™s contributions and recommend them for invitation.

---

## Sending the GitHub Invitation

Use the following Slack command in the `#community-management` channel:

Where `[organization name]` should be one of:

- [`meshery`](https://meshery.io) - to send the invite to the email address to join the Meshery GitHub organization under the "contributors" team.

- [`meshery-extensions`](https://meshery.io/extensions) - to send the invite to the email address to join the Meshery Extensions GitHub organization under the "plugins" team.

```
    /invite-github contributor@example.com [organization name]
```

As a community, we have put together an excellent set of learning materials and training resources to guide you through learning about cloud native infrastucture.

You can review the [complete list of learning resources](https://docs.meshery.io/) or jump straight to the type of training you prefer:

- Hands on [tutorials](https://docs.meshery.io/guides/tutorials).
- Interactive labs in [playground](https://play.meshery.io).
- Well-architected patterns for Kubernetes and all CNCF projects at [Meshery catalog](https://meshery.io/catalog)
- Recorded training and talks on the [Meshery YouTube Channel.](https://www.youtube.com/@mesheryio/playlists).

These materials were created to be interactive, easy to use, and free for all.

## Sharing what you've learned at a technical event


At Meshery, we participate in many different technical conferences, in international events, in online workshops, at meetups, and so on. Our engagement in these events ranges across various cloud native and open source topics and varies between speaking, hosting workshops, managing project booths, and so on. Our engagement in these events, increases awareness about our projects and the individual community members that contribute to the projects.



A member of the Meshery community has presented at every KubeCon since its inception. Join us at the many events we host or participate in. Check out [Meshery events](https://meshery.io/talks-and-presentations) to for a current list of events.

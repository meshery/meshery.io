## How to Participate

## Steps to Create a Design 

### 1. Start a New Design
- Go to [Kanvas](https://kanvas.new/extension/meshmap).  
- Begin with a new design or import a file (for example, a YAML file or a Helm chart).

### 2. Build Your Design
- Drag and drop components from the panel.  
- Edit the components and add annotations to define relationships between them.

### 3. Save or Import Your Design
- Once youâ€™re done, save your design.  
- If youâ€™d like to bring in an existing design, use the **Import** option in Kanvas and then save it.

### 4. Publish to the Meshery Catalog
- You can publish your design to the Meshery Catalog.  
- For a visual walkthrough of the publishing process, see [this issue #15790](https://github.com/meshery/meshery/issues/15790).

### 5. Export Your Design
- Designs can be exported as an **OCI image**, **Helm chart**, or **YAML file**.

### 6. Raise a Pull Request
- Add your exported design file under this path structure: `meshery/docs/hacktoberfest/<design-name>`
- Create a pull request (PR) with your design to the Meshery repository.  
- This will make your design available for review and inclusion in the Meshery Catalog. ðŸŽ‰

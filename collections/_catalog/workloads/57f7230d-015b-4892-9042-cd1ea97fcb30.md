patternInfo: |
  This design configures the Kubernetes Metrics Server for monitoring cluster-wide resource metrics. It defines a Kubernetes Deployment, Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) rules, and other resources for the Metrics Server's deployment and operation.
patternCaveats: |
  This design configures the Kubernetes Metrics Server for resource monitoring. Ensure that RBAC and ServiceAccount configurations are secure to prevent unauthorized access. Adjust Metrics Server settings for specific metrics and monitor resource usage regularly to prevent resource overuse. Implement probes for reliability and maintain correct API service settings. Plan for scalability and choose the appropriate namespace. Set up monitoring for issue detection and establish data backup and recovery plans. Regularly update components for improved security and performance.

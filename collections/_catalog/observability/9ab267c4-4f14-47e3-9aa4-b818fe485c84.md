patternInfo: CronJobs are highly useful because they run in their own separate containers, letting you run an operation in the exact containers you need. This allows you to lock each CronJob to a specific version of a container, update each cron individually, and customize it with any specific dependencies it needs.
patternCaveats: This simple Kubeneretes CronJob will log "hello" to stdout every 10 seconds or so.

patternInfo: CronJobs are highly useful because they run in their own separate containers, letting you run an operation in the exact containers you need. This allows you to lock each CronJob to a specific version of a container, update each cron individually, and customize it with any specific dependencies it needs.
patternCaveats: Permissions to create and delete indexes, modify index configurations, and add, remove, modify, and query documents. In addition, permissions to log on to the Kibana console are revoked.

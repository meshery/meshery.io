patternInfo: |
  This cloud-native design consists of a Kubernetes Pod running an Nginx container and a Kubernetes Service named service. The Pod uses the image nginx with an image pull policy of Always. The Service defines two ports: one with port 80 and target port 8080, and another with port 80. The Service allows communication between the Pod and external clients on port 80.
patternCaveats: |
  Networking should be properly configured to enable communication between pod and services. Ensure sufficient resources are available in the cluster.

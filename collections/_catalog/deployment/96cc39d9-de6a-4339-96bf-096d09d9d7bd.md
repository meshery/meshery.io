patternInfo: This design includes a running Apache Zookeeper on Kubernetes using StatefulSets, PodDisruptionBudgets, and PodAntiAffinity.
patternCaveats: You must have a cluster with at least four nodes, and each node requires at least 2 CPUs and 4 GiB of memory. In this tutorial you will cordon and drain the cluster's nodes. This means that the cluster will terminate and evict all Pods on its nodes, and the nodes will temporarily become unschedulable. You should use a dedicated cluster for this tutorial, or you should ensure that the disruption you cause will not interfere with other tenants.

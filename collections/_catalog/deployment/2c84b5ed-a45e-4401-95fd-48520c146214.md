patternInfo: |
  This is an example Helm chart for deploying the Caddy web server in a Kubernetes cluster. Here's a breakdown of the different components and files in this Helm chart: 1. **Chart.yaml**: Metadata about the Helm chart, including its name, version, and API version. 2. **values.yaml**: Configuration values for the Helm chart. These values can be customized when deploying the chart. Notable configurations include the Caddy image repository and tag, replica count, port, TLS settings, and whether to enable ingress. 3. **deployment.yaml**: Kubernetes Deployment resource definition. It specifies how the Caddy application should be deployed, including the number of replicas, container image, container arguments (to run Caddy with a custom config file), and volume mounts for configuration. 4. **service.yaml**: Kubernetes Service resource definition. It defines a service for Caddy, which can be accessed from outside the cluster. This example sets up a LoadBalancer type service. 5. **configmap.yaml**: Kubernetes ConfigMap resource definition. It contains two pieces of configuration data: the Caddyfile (custom Caddy configuration) and TLS settings in JSON format. 6. **ingress.yaml**: Kubernetes Ingress resource definition. If enabled, it defines how incoming traffic should be routed to the Caddy service based on host and paths. This example specifies routing rules for `example.com` with paths `/api/*` and `/*` to different backend services. The Helm chart provides a convenient way to package and deploy Caddy with various customizations and configurations. Users can override values in `values.yaml` to tailor the deployment to their specific needs when installing the Helm chart.
patternCaveats: |
  Ensure sufficient resources are available in the cluster.

  description: "A KEDA HTTPScaledObject is a Kubernetes custom resource definition (CRD) used in conjunction with the KEDA HTTP Add-on to enable the automatic scaling of your HTTP-based applications based on incoming HTTP traffic. This means your application can dynamically adjust the number of replicas (pods) running to handle varying workloads efficiently."

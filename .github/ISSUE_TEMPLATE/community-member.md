**About adding a new Community Member**
- Adding a new profile is an act of recognition of consistent contribution to project(s).
- Profile pictures should be square in aspect ratio.

**About updating a Community Member**
- As a community member progresses through the contributor ladder, their role may change over time.

_Active_ and _Inactive_ Members
- Once a member, always a member. Contributions from a community member will stand for all-time.
- The consistency by which a member contributes (their activity in the community) may ebb and flow organically as their availability to spend time doing so comes and goes.
- Profile status should reflect the Active vs Inactive status of their current community involvement.
